# txt-to-HTML-converter
A conversion tool made for converting txt file to standard HTML.

The main purpose of this program is to create TIL (Today I learned) HTML files for blogging and personal purposes. A TIL can be pretty useful to anyone creating one as they can write down important things that they learned about and share it with others, or just keep it for themselves as something to reference. However, you can also use it as a simple txt to HTML converter. 

# How to Use
This program is meant to be run on a CLI. First, make sure that you have the lastest version of python installed. You can get the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once python is installed make sure it's added to your environment variables (there should be an option to do so on the installer). Next, you can call on the program in your terminal or command line by doing so `txt_to_html filename.txt` or `txt_to_html foldername`. If you don't have Python in your environment variables, you maybe have to add the word `python` before `txt_to_html`.
